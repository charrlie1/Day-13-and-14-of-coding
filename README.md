# Day-13-and-14-of-coding
this includes a program that applies NRI to solve simple math equations and also a program that compares number of steps that leads to convergence btw bisection method and NRI

this is designed to take in simple math equations(polynomial, transendental : exponential, trigonometric etc) 

simple eqns like : x**a - b, 2*a +/- b and other trigs maybe used

 x**a - b*x + c would output an error
